I am a Human Computer Interaction researcher and PhD Candidate supported by the <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2025">ï£¿ Apple Scholars in AIML PhD Fellowship</a>, <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/stories/ruei-che-chang-receives-rackham-international-student-fellowship">Rackham International Students Fellowship</a>, and Weinberg Cognitive Science Fellowship.

I am a part of [Human-AI Lab](https://guoanhong.com/) at <a href='https://cse.engin.umich.edu/'>Department of Computer Science, University of Michigan</a>, advised by [Anhong Guo](https://guoanhong.com/).

My research focuses on developing agents that can understand and describe real-world surroundings for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, with a technical core that is adaptable to broader contexts.
